	* Slight cosmetic changes
	* Bugfix : Since version 5.0 iOS allows for native scrolling in web apps
	  we do now detect which version is running and decide whether or not we
	  need iScroll (Thanks to Gerd Niemetz for reporting this issue)
	* Copyright in splash screen fixed

0.31
Bugfixes, cosmetic enhancements
	* Contexts (predefined filters) can now be selected from the setup UI
	  (see README.TXT and include/config.php)
	* Landscape orientation now show the toolbar as expected
	* it's no longer required to have "short_open_tag" enabled in php.ini

Due to limited resources, I'm now focusing on supporting iOS devices ONLY. This means
ZiPEC may not display correctly on some devices, and may even not work as expected.
However, and as always, the door is open to anyone who may want to help, by sharing
specific CSS code for other platforms.

	* New icon, provided by Shannon Gernyi (Thanks !)
	* Splash Screen added at startup (previously, an outdated snapshot of the list was shown,
	  which was a bit misleading)
	* Current Alerts Porlets allows you to access your events list from
	  the dashboard using the 'site window' portlet
